Enclosed herewith please find:A special news digest, issued by our organization, which deals with the question of the sinister aspects of the circumstances surrounding the deaths of a number of political detainees;A second news digest from our organization, dealing with the serious development of the setting up of the Bureau of State Security by the South African “Government”.Our organization is very concerned about the circumstances under which one of our leading members, Caleb Mayekiso, has recently died while in gaol in South Africa. Indeed, we are very concerned about the sinister circumstances under which a number of people have recently died in detention. We urge that everything possible be done to draw the attention of the world to these developments with a view to raising to the maximum possible awareness of the terrible conditions prevailing in the gaols of South Africa where political prisoners are being held.The second document deals with the introduction of the Bureau of State Security, which quite clearly is one of the legal instruments whereby the South African racialists intend to entrench themselves still further. It is reported that two judges of the Supreme Court have indicated their intention of resigning if this Bill is enacted.We trust that your Committee will see its way clear to render the maximum support to our viewpoint in these matters.(Signed)R.
